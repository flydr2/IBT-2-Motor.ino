# IBT-2-Motor.ino
This is my motor.ino to work with Pypilot using IBT-2. USING Arduino MEGA... NOTE SERIAL PORT 1.

There is also a version for ESP32 which will get improvements over time.

After working days to analyse pypilot motor.ino I started this to replace it with these file.

It is work in progress but it does work with no end-stop or any safety at this point.
Anyone willing to help here would be great.
<B> Remember it is work in progress and could burnout your motor or worse </B>

I will continue to improve this with time.
Also I will make an ESP32 version which will also contain a simple backup autopilot (self-contained) controlled by wifi or bluetooth.
