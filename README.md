# IBT-2-Motor.ino
This is my motor.ino to work with Pypilot using IBT-2. USING Arduino MEGA... NOTE SERIAL PORT 1

After working days to analyse motor.ino I started this to replace it...

It is work in progress but it does work with no end-stop or any safety at this point.
Anyone willing to help here would be great.
